# Day 01 - [13 June 2025]

## âœ… What I Did
- I styled my sign up and login forms.

- Planned a bit about restructuring the database (moving from members table to members column in userinformation table).

- Added authentication in `dashboard` route.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- Today I learned that if I dont authenticate the route that is connected in any way to previous one or is required after being logged in. A user will be able to access the route by typing the path in the url.

## ðŸ”§ Next Up
- I need to create a functionality that will also a user to join the club.

- Allow logged in user to create messages.

- Make sure the database can track who created the message.
