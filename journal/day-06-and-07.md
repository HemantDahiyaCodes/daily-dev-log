# Day 06 + 07 - [18 June 2025]

## âœ… What I Did
- Fixed my `/dashboard` route from being accessed from url **(if the user is not logged in)** and protected other routes as well.

- Allowed the user to be able to create messages. Played around with it some to ensure it is working.

- Ensured the database is storing the messages.

- Retrieved messages from the database.


## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- I can use middleware functions to protect my routes from unauthorized access.

## ðŸ”§ Next Up
- Now I will work on displaying the stored messages in the database and create an admin user that can delete those messages (both from db and view).
