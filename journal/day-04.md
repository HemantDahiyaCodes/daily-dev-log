# Day 04 - [14 June 2025]

## âœ… What I Did
- I had an exam today so that wasted almost all my morning to late afternoon. I was tired once I got home, took a nap and some rest.

- Was trying to figure out how to allow a user to be a member, tried an approach but didn't work out.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- A user object is generated that we can access by using `req.user`.


## ðŸ”§ Next Up
Now I am going to go a bit back and Plan this step out first. From what I think I need to have a form that when submitted, will send a signal and I will update the current user's membership.
