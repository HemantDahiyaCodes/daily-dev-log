## âœ… What I Did
- Fixed the sign up form not signing up new users (because of event.preventDefault()).

- Completed the task that allows a user to be a member of the club.

- Created the message form that lets logged in users create messages.


## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- I can use middleware functions to manipulate the incoming requests and make changes throughout the website.


## ðŸ”§ Next Up
Now I need to work on storing those messages with the author's name in the database and display them on the `dashboard`.
