# Day 01 - [Date]

## âœ… What I Did
- Setup my database structure. Created tables for users information, messages, membership and admin.

- Broke down the project and worked on MVP list.

- Created routes for sign up and log in. Created their forms

- Added authentication by using `passport.js` -- Seperated it from flooding the main file.

- Secured password by using `bcryptjs`.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- Got a tough lesson from async/await about pending promises and the reason a promise might be pending.

- If an async function is called but not awaited, and its result is logged, the output will show a pending Promise, because the function returns a Promise that hasn't resolved yet.


## ðŸ”§ Next Up
- Now I will start working on making the sign-up and log-in page look a bit better.

- Work on adding a `Become a member` option on the dashboard so a user can create message.
