# Daily Dev Log 🧠💻

This is my daily development journal where I:
- Track my learning progress
- Document concepts & code patterns
- Log what I built and fixed each day
- Stay accountable to my 5-month dev journey

## 📁 Structure
- `logs/` — Daily logs (Day 1, Day 2...)
- `notes/` — Concept notes (auth, git, clean code, etc.)
- `projects/` — Project breakdowns, feature planning

## 🚀 Let's Build.
